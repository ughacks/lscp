Amygdala Stage 1 — Hard Passage Set (v2)
=========================================
Designed to stress-test surprisal-based detection by narrowing
the gap between categories and introducing edge cases.

Design principles:
  - aligned:  Textbook-correct but written in unusual phrasing,
              or involving less-commonly-stated specifics that a
              well-trained model should still predict confidently.
  - novel:    Real corrections / recent findings sourced from
              peer-reviewed literature or credible journalism (2024-2025).
              Many are counterintuitive or contradict widespread belief.
              Some overlap with information partially present in training data.
  - corrupt:  Plausible falsehoods that CLOSELY MIMIC novel passages.
              They cite real institutions, use correct background facts,
              but embed a single critical error in an otherwise true narrative.
              Designed to be nearly indistinguishable from novel by surprisal alone.

60 passages: 20 aligned, 20 novel, 20 corrupt.
Each corrupt passage has a paired novel passage on a related topic
to test whether Stage 1 can separate them.

Sources cited in comments for reproducibility.

This intracardiac nervous system, sometimes called the heart's little brain, consists of approximately 40,000 neurons organized into ganglia on the heart's surface. The network can modulate heart rate and contractility independently of the brain, and its dysfunction has been linked to arrhythmias. The findings suggest that the heart's own neural circuitry is far more complex and autonomous than earlier models assumed.",
